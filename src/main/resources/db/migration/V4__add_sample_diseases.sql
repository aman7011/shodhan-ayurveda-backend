('Acidity', 
 'Digestive', 
 'Acidity, also known as Acid Reflux or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), is a chronic digestive condition where stomach acid or bile irritates the food pipe lining (esophagus). This occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) weakens, allowing acid to flow back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and potential damage over time. GERD is often linked to lifestyle choices, dietary habits, and sometimes underlying health conditions like obesity or hernias.',
 'Key causes of acidity include: 
 1. **Pitta Dosha Imbalance** – In Ayurvedic medicine, an excess of Pitta energy (fire element) can overheat the digestive system, leading to increased acid production.
 2. **Dietary Habits** – Spicy, oily, or acidic foods like citrus, chocolate, tomatoes, and caffeine can exacerbate acid reflux.
 3. **Stress** – High levels of stress and anxiety can increase stomach acid production and contribute to digestive problems.
 4. **Irregular Eating Habits** – Skipping meals, overeating, or eating just before sleeping can increase acidity.
 5. **Physical Conditions** – A weakened LES, obesity, or pregnancy may also contribute to acid reflux.',
 'Acidity symptoms include:
 - **Heartburn** – A burning sensation in the chest, especially after meals.
 - **Regurgitation** – Sour or bitter taste in the mouth due to stomach acid reaching the esophagus.
 - **Chest Pain** – Some people experience chest discomfort or pain, which can mimic heart disease.
 - **Bloating & Nausea** – Feeling overly full or nauseous, especially after eating.
 - **Dysphagia** – Difficulty swallowing or feeling like food is stuck in the throat.',
 'Treatment typically involves a combination of:
 - **Medications** – Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce acid production, H2 blockers, and antacids for immediate relief.
 - **Surgical Options** – In severe cases, surgery such as fundoplication may be required to reinforce the LES.
 - **Dietary Changes** – Eliminating trigger foods, eating smaller meals, and not lying down immediately after eating.
 - **Stress Management** – Techniques like meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises to reduce stress levels.',
 'Effective home remedies include:
 - **Ginger Tea** – Soothes the stomach and reduces acid production.
 - **Aloe Vera Juice** – Helps heal the esophageal lining and reduces inflammation.
 - **Apple Cider Vinegar** – Mixed with water to balance stomach acid and improve digestion.
 - **Bananas** – They help neutralize stomach acids and protect the esophagus from irritation.',
 'Lifestyle recommendations for managing acidity:
 1. **Regular Eating Schedule** – Eat meals at the same time each day and avoid large meals at night.
 2. **Elevate Your Head During Sleep** – Use a pillow to elevate your head at least 6 inches to prevent acid from rising.
 3. **Hydration** – Drink plenty of water to dilute stomach acid.
 4. **Stress Reduction** – Engage in daily stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or journaling.
 5. **Exercise** – Engage in moderate exercise (but avoid exercising immediately after meals).'

('Psoriasis', 
 'Skin', 
 'Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition where skin cells grow at an accelerated rate, leading to thick, red, scaly patches on the skin. These patches can appear anywhere on the body, though common areas include the scalp, elbows, and knees. Psoriasis can also affect the nails and joints. The condition tends to flare-up and subside in cycles, and severity can range from mild to severe. In some cases, psoriasis can lead to joint pain (psoriatic arthritis).',
 'Psoriasis is caused by:
 1. **Genetics** – A family history of psoriasis or autoimmune diseases increases the likelihood of developing it.
 2. **Immune System Dysfunction** – The immune system attacks healthy skin cells, causing inflammation and rapid skin cell turnover.
 3. **Triggers** – Factors like stress, infections, smoking, alcohol consumption, certain medications (e.g., beta-blockers, lithium), and even weather changes can trigger or worsen psoriasis.
 4. **Environmental Factors** – Cold, dry air, and lack of sunlight may contribute to flare-ups.',
 'Symptoms of psoriasis include:
 - **Red, Raised Patches of Skin** – These are typically covered with thick, silvery scales.
 - **Itching and Burning** – The affected areas often feel itchy or sore.
 - **Cracked Skin** – Skin may crack and bleed in severe cases.
 - **Psoriatic Arthritis** – Joint pain and swelling in addition to skin symptoms.
 - **Nail Changes** – Pitting, discoloration, and detachment of the nails.',
 'Psoriasis treatment includes:
 1. **Topical Treatments** – Corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, and topical retinoids.
 2. **Phototherapy** – UV light therapy to reduce inflammation.
 3. **Systemic Treatments** – Biologics or immunosuppressants for moderate to severe cases.
 4. **Natural Remedies** – Herbs like turmeric, aloe vera, and neem, which have anti-inflammatory properties, are also used to treat psoriasis.',
 'Home remedies for psoriasis:
 - **Aloe Vera Gel** – Known to soothe and hydrate irritated skin.
